This R script focuses on sentiment analysis of Twitter data using the Bing lexicon. After installing and loading necessary libraries (`tidytext`, `ggplot2`, and `dplyr`), it loads a Twitter training dataset without column names, preprocesses the text by removing URLs and special characters, and converts it to lowercase. The sentiment of the text is then analyzed using the Bing lexicon, and the average sentiment scores for positive and negative sentiments are visualized in a bar plot. The resulting plot offers insights into the sentiment distribution, while the minimal theme enhances clarity, omitting x-axis text for a cleaner presentation. Adjustments can be made to cater to specific analytical needs.
